Cramer's Rule is a powerful technique used to solve systems of linear equations by expressing each unknown variable as a ratio of determinants. It provides an elegant and efficient method for finding unique solutions to systems of equations when certain conditions are met. Cramer's Rule is particularly useful when the coefficient matrix of the system is square and invertible.
